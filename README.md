# templates
This repo stores short Python, JavaScript and HTML templates that I use to support my son's art website on AWS.

# image_upload_thumbnail.py
  When file with jpg extention is dropped in that directory, the script creates a thumbnail.
  The script is useful for autoamted updates of a website, when person populating website is not familiar with HTML.
